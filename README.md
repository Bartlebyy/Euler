This a folder where I will put my responses for individual puzzles from projecteuler.net

This is meant to be a simple everyday practice that will help keep my ruby skills in check.

My goal for each problem is to quickly and cleanly write up some code that will find the solution to the puzzle in under a minute.

I have currently completed 6 puzzles.
